model -> accuracy
specificity and sensitivity, physical methods of how often it gets it right and wrong

give them a place hey can locate an algorithm to run agaisnt the data

container:
- inputted images
- applied the algorithm to it-> got an accuracy measure

I've proved I can dockerise images and apply a classifier

- what UI will I give them to enable them to put them into a copy to a doctor file
-> python script that they injest into 

UI [MAKE IT NICEEE]
-> input data
-> create algorithms and test them
GREAT UI!
